    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello Internets. I hope you have been doing great.
I work at a computer 40+ hours week and sitting for that long isn&rsquo;t good for you.
So I been wanting to try out a standing desk. I was definitely not certain I could stand for an 8 hour day
and not wanting to be in lots of pain I decided to make an adjustable desk.
So my roommate and I built me an adjustable desk. It came out amazingly well.

<h2>Planning Process</h2>

<p>I thought a lot about making an adjustable desk cheaply, a coworker of mine built an adjustable
topper for his desk very cheaply using 2 pieces of plywood an electric drill and a RV jack stand.
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13440652345" title="Untitled by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3735/13440652345_06d567e6d1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Untitled"></a>
This setup works well and is super cheap and easy, but doesn&rsquo;t look great.
So I looked for different options. I was really impressed with the look of the <a href="http://www.milk.dk"> Milk Desk</a>.
I thought about making my own version of the milk desk with a large RV jack stand inside the center console.
There were some issues with the format of the milk desk that I don&rsquo;t like.
Mostly with a center column it makes sitting at the center of the desk awkward for your knees and
if it&rsquo;s not centered then it would be difficult to remain stable.
This led me to this guys build which looked great.
So I picked up some linear actuators on eBay for approx $40 each.
So I went to home depot picked up a sheet of cheap hardwood plywood and some aluminum strips we started building.
My roommate is a finish carpenter so he was responsible for all of the wood working awesomeness.</p>

<p>That left me responsible for the electronics.
It&rsquo;s a very simple circuit containing an ATX power supply for the +5v(micro) and
the +12v &amp; -12V (the actuators run on 24v), adafruit&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1501">trinket</a>
(to read the buttons and switch the relays), 2 rad looking <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/559">buttons</a>
a dpdt relay(to reverse the polarity of the power to the actuators), and dpst relay (on and off power to the actuators).</p>

<h2>Build Pics/Log</h2>

<p>The build process took way longer then it should have mostly because I am still bad at making things in the real world.  There were also a lot of issues with inductive voltage spikes on switching on/off the actuators.</p>

<p>Cutting the desk and adding a lip to the bottom went pretty quickly the thing that took forever was adding the metal edge.
Here is the feet and the monitor stand.</p>

<p>We used wall flanges and pipe fittings to attach the desk to the feet.</p>

<p>after we sanded/ground down the metal lip and sanded the desk we put some red stain and sealed the desk.</p>

<p>Without more support the desk was very unstable. So we (my roommate) built some boxes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13419797085" title="Adjustable Desk Build by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3746/13419797085_dddd1fcff6.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Adjustable Desk Build"></a></p>

<p>The small box attaches to the foot and the large box attaches to the underside of the desk.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13419782885" title="Adjustable Desk Build by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7123/13419782885_62d09e94d2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Adjustable Desk Build"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13419897873" title="Adjustable Desk Build by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3813/13419897873_5a11a823bd.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Adjustable Desk Build"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13419895973" title="Adjustable Desk Build by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3806/13419895973_07fe6c154a.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Adjustable Desk Build"></a></p>

<p>This is what the desk looks like when it lowered.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13419783995" title="Adjustable Desk Build by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2897/13419783995_01cd1e7703.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Adjustable Desk Build"></a></p>

<p>And this is what it looks like raised.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13419777015" title="Adjustable Desk Build by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2855/13419777015_c0e85a9185.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Adjustable Desk Build"></a></p>

<p>Here i am calibrating the 2 actuators by with power resistors to slow one of the down so they move at approximately the same speed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13419890343" title="Adjustable Desk Build by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2882/13419890343_537668f9e3.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Adjustable Desk Build"></a></p>

<p>And here is the finished product.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/13451225113" title="Untitled by Daniel Loman, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3716/13451225113_93ee292648.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Untitled"></a></p>

<h2>Future Additions</h2>

<p>There are quite a lot of additions I want to make to the desk.
Mostly using a proper H-Bridge motor controller instead of my janky DPDT nonsense.
The actuators I have also have built in hall effect sensors, so I really want to be able to read those and
auto level the desk. The desk is working great and looks awesome and I am loving standing most of the day.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Was on adafruit a few weeks backs and found <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1097"> this little guy </a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1095"> the corresponding remote </a>.
I immeditely purchased that I had one of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BeesClover-4-Channel-interface-dupont-15-20mA/dp/B00E4HJA0Q/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1387830865&sr=8-7&keywords=relay+board"> relay boards </a> lying around in my closet. So i decided to make a 315 Mhz controlled junction box for turning on my lights with a remote. Here is a video of the finished product</p>

<b> Stuff I had laying around </b><br>
5v old cell phone charger <br>
Old computer power supply cable <br>
fiber glass resin (optional) <br></p>

<p><b> Step 1:</b><br>
Look at the location of the vcc gnd and control pins on your relay board and match them up as best as possible with your remote board.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11520002913/player/924bb87a6d" height="480" width="640"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>


<br>


<p><b> Step 2:</b><br>
Solder the corresponding pins from the relay to the remote. (there is a orange wire in in the back/underneath hooking up my vcc)</p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11519997473/player/65477bd33d" height="480" width="640"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>




<br>


<p><b> Step 3:</b><br>
Attach longer leads to ground and vcc to allow for connection to a power supply.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11519888165/player/f1702f4226" height="480" width="640"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>




<br>


<p><b> Step 4:</b><br>
Take the junction box and line the inside with electrical tape. this will keep things from shorting accidentally. Also if you decide to try and waterproof it will take the resin from seeping through the holes.<br></p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11519881095/player/6367fb057d" height="640" width="480"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>


<br>


<p><b> Step 5:</b><br>
Take the outlets and on the cold side (big prong) on both outlets break off the tab connecting the 2 junctions together. If you look closely in the picture I have broken off the tab on the plug on the right but not yet for the one on the left. <br></p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11519879395/player/a87c0062bf" height="640" width="480"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>




<br>


<p><b> Step 6:</b><br>
Connect 4 wires to the middle slot of each relay and solder them together</p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11519955486/player/dd19df626d" height="640" width="480"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>


<br>


<p><b> Step 7:</b><br>
Grab an old cellphone charger (the smaller the better) and connect 5v to vcc and gnd to gnd.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11519973103/player/f2cec6a0ae" height="640" width="480"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>


<br>


<p><b> Step 8:</b><br>
Attach the the 4 cold pins to the left post of the relay.
If you want specific order in which outlet is controlled by which button this is the time to figure this out.
Depending on how you soldered the controller make sure your desired button controls the corresponding desired outlet.
(You can always test this by powering up the dc power supply and seeing which lights on the relay board switch when specific buttons are pressed and wiring the desired outlets from there.)</p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11519884284/player/2aea9368c8" height="640" width="480"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>




<br>


<p><b> Step 9:</b><br>
Connect the neutral line to the 4 lines coming out of the outlets (2 green and 2 black for me), and connect the hot line to the 4 lines that you soldered together in step 6. Then hook up the cellphone power supply to the 120v hot and nuetral lines to give it power.
Connect the ground pin of the power cords to the ground lead on one of the electrical outlets. This will wire the case to ground and provide some saftey if something accidentally shorts against the housing.
Then double check everything is taped and heat shrunked safely and plug it in and test and make sure everything works.</p>

<br>




<br>


<p><b> Step 10:</b><br>
Carefully cram everything into the junction box and tighten all the screws</p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/108066226@N08/11519966443/player/aa82b20a6a" height="480" width="640"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>


<br>


<p><b>Step 11:(I havent tried this one yet&hellip;)</b><br>
To make the electronics inside water resistant fill the junction box with fiberglass resin. this will allow the box to be used outside and get rained on&hellip;.or you could spend a little more money and just buy a water proof junction box and outlets from the start and be significantly safer&hellip;but where is the fun in that?</p>

    <updated>2013-12-19T22:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://dloman.github.io/blog/2013/12/19/alternative-for-quick-cli-filesystem-navagation-shortcutting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I saw this great <a href="http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/08/16/quickly-navigate-your-filesystem-from-the-command-line.html"> blog post</a> about an easy way to create and remove shortcuts for commandline navagation to often used directories.
In the past I would often manually make bash aliases for commonly used directories, so I was psyched to automate this. I much prefer just typing the <code>DirName</code> instead of the <code>jump DirName</code> used in Jeroen&rsquo;s version, so I modified his commands with my own.
Here are the commands I came up with.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>function mark {
</span><span class='line'>  echo "alias $1='cd $(pwd)'" &gt;&gt; ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases ; source ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>function unmark {
</span><span class='line'>  sed -e "/^alias $1='cd/d" -i ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases ; source ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>function marks {
</span><span class='line'>  cat ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases | grep "='cd" | sed -e 's/alias //' -e "s/='cd / \=\&gt; /" -e "s/'$//" -e "/^  echo /d" -e "/&&/d" -e "/^  sed/d"
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<!-- more -->


<p>This may not be the most elegant way of doing things (that sed command is fairly heinous) but it works great.</p>

<p>BTW keeping my bash_aliases file inside of dropbox is amazing&hellip;aliases and functions instantly appear on all my machines. It&rsquo;s rad.</p>

<p>P.S. originally I had the <code>unmark</code> command looking like this</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>function unmark {
</span><span class='line'>  sed -e "/^alias $1/d" -i ~/.bash_aliases ; source ~/.bash_aliases
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which seems like a only minor modification from the current version. This seemingly minor change of <code>alias $1</code> &ndash;> <code>alias $1='cd</code> looks like nothing, but one time I accidentally typed</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$mark</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which created the line <code>alias ='cd ~/WhereverIWasWhenIDidThis'</code> in my <code>~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases</code>
realising I just made a empty alias I immediatly tried removing the alias with</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$unmark</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which proceded to delete all aliases in my <code>~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases</code>!!!
That was interesting, thank goodness for dropbox backing things up (another reason to keep config files in dropbox).
Let me know what you think in the comments or hit me up on twitter.</p>

<p>Was parusing boing boing a few months ago and I came upon this gem from childhood</p>

<iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://dloman.github.io//www.youtube.com/embed/zjhJSD8RU4k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>I decided to make a halloween costume out of a combination of the adafruit led matrix eyes and a triceratops head.
Kinda forgot to take a lot of pictures until it was mostly assembled already&hellip;</p>

    <updated>2013-10-15T22:28:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dloman.github.io/blog/2013/10/15/new-mail-script</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wrote a quick little script today to check and see if I have new email.
I am using the standard imaplib library along with python-ntlm with a imap patch found on <a href="https://github.com/xulz/python-ntlm">https://github.com/xulz/python-ntlm</a>
I didn&rsquo;t really want to save my cleartext password in the script so pickled the <code>ImapNtlmAuthHandler</code></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>AuthFile = open(SuperCoolFileLocation,'wb')
</span><span class='line'>AuthHandler = IMAPNtlmAuthHandler(r"domain\username", "password")
</span><span class='line'>pickle.dump(AuthHandler, AuthFile)
</span><span class='line'>AuthFile.close()</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s probably not much more secure, but it&rsquo;s more secure then saving in plaintext. If I am wrong and there is a better safer way to do it let me know.</p>

<p>Here is the the script I use to get the total number of messages.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>import getpass, imaplib, pickle
