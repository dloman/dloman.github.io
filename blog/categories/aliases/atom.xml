    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back I wrote a <a href=http://danloman.org/blog/2013/12/19/alternative-for-quick-cli-filesystem-navagation-shortcutting/> little bash function</a>
which automatically creates bash aliases for moving around in commonly used directories in my file system.
This worked awesomely until one day I was working on a machine where I was not my normal username.
The root of my problem was that I use a synced bash_alias file, so  all of my bash_alias files are identical across multiple machines and users.
normal this works great, but when I used the alias and moved to edit files in what i thought was /home/differentuser/Source/ I was acutally editing /home/dloman/Source/.
I didnt realize this mistake and got very confused when I tried to save my edits and was unable to.
Needless to say it took me awhile of flailing about, thinking I was completly insane until I figured out what was happening.
I edited the my mark function with this sed command to replace the expanded <code>$HOME</code> path with the actual string <code>$HOME</code>. The updated command is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function mark
{
  echo "alias $1='cd $(pwd)'" | sed -e "s:$HOME:\$HOME:g" &gt;&gt; ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases ;
  source ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now my bash_aliases file is sharable regardless of which user I am logged in as.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I saw this great <a href="http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/08/16/quickly-navigate-your-filesystem-from-the-command-line.html"> blog post</a> about an easy way to create and remove shortcuts for commandline navagation to often used directories.
In the past I would often manually make bash aliases for commonly used directories, so I was psyched to automate this. I much prefer just typing the <code>DirName</code> instead of the <code>jump DirName</code> used in Jeroen&rsquo;s version, so I modified his commands with my own.
Here are the commands I came up with.</p>

<pre><code>function mark {
  echo "alias $1='cd $(pwd)'" &gt;&gt; ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases ; source ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases
}
function unmark {
  sed -e "/^alias $1='cd/d" -i ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases ; source ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases
}
function marks {
  cat ~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases | grep "='cd" | sed -e 's/alias //' -e "s/='cd / \=\&gt; /" -e "s/'$//" -e "/^  echo /d" -e "/&amp;&amp;/d" -e "/^  sed/d"
}
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>This may not be the most elegant way of doing things (that sed command is fairly heinous) but it works great.</p>

<p>BTW keeping my bash_aliases file inside of dropbox is amazing&hellip;aliases and functions instantly appear on all my machines. It&rsquo;s rad.</p>

<p>P.S. originally I had the <code>unmark</code> command looking like this</p>

<pre><code>}
function unmark {
  sed -e "/^alias $1/d" -i ~/.bash_aliases ; source ~/.bash_aliases
}
</code></pre>

<p>which seems like a only minor modification from the current version. This seemingly minor change of <code>alias $1</code> -> <code>alias $1='cd</code> looks like nothing, but one time I accidentally typed
<code>
$mark
</code>
which created the line <code>alias ='cd ~/WhereverIWasWhenIDidThis'</code> in my <code>~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases</code>
realising I just made a empty alias I immediatly tried removing the alias with
<code>
$unmark
</code>
which proceded to delete all aliases in my <code>~/Dropbox/Config/bash_aliases</code>!!!
That was interesting, thank goodness for dropbox backing things up (another reason to keep config files in dropbox).
Let me know what you think in the comments or hit me up on twitter.</p>
